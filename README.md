# Concurrent-Programming
Simulates Operation of Fruit Factory using Threads, Synchronization &amp; Semaphores in Java

# Motivation
The simulation helps to understand how threads, synchronization, locks, semaphores work in Java concurrent programming. The threads are responsible for different operation of fruit factory including the filling, sealing, sterilising, labelling, loading the cans. The cans will be passed in between the threads to 'carry out' the operation to simulate a fruit factory

# Tech/Framework Used
1. Semaphores
2. Synchronization
